# death

death is a fun thing to think about.

what will happen when I die?  I'm not worried about my stuff.  I hope my things are sold and used for drug money, honestly.  but that's for my like.. things.  I hope the house and stuff goes to my family.

so I need this project to do two things:

logic: this should indepedently determine if I'm living or dead, by hooking into my internet presence.  if I'm in a coma for a year, it should falsely assume I'm dead.

payload: a glittery website with gifs, possibly sounds, that my friends can sign the guest book on.  I want it obnoxious af.  this is easiest and I'll probably make it first.
